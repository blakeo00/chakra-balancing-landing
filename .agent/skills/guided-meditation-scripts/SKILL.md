# Guided Meditation Scripts

Create immersive, therapeutic guided meditation scripts that lead listeners through transformative inner experiences.

## Core Principles

1. **Pacing & Breath** — Use ellipses (`...`) and `[pause X seconds]` markers to control pacing. Every script should open with breath awareness and grounding.
2. **Sensory Language** — Engage all five senses. Describe textures, temperatures, colors, sounds, and subtle sensations to deepen immersion.
3. **Progressive Relaxation** — Guide the listener through a body scan or progressive relaxation sequence before the main visualization.
4. **Safe Container** — Establish a sense of safety and choice. Use phrases like *"Allow yourself..."*, *"If it feels right..."*, *"You are always in control..."*
5. **Present Tense** — Write in second person, present tense: *"You are walking..."*, *"You feel..."*, *"You notice..."*
6. **Gentle Return** — Always close with a gentle re-grounding sequence, bringing awareness back to the body and room.

## Script Structure

Every guided meditation script should follow this structure:

```
1. OPENING (1-2 min)
   - Welcome & intention setting
   - Breath awareness (3-5 breaths)
   - Permission to relax

2. INDUCTION (2-4 min)
   - Progressive relaxation or body scan
   - Deepening technique (counting, staircase, floating)

3. MAIN JOURNEY (5-20 min)
   - Core visualization or theme
   - Emotional processing or insight moments
   - Affirmations woven naturally into the narrative

4. INTEGRATION (1-2 min)
   - Anchoring the experience
   - Gratitude or self-compassion moment

5. RETURN (1-2 min)
   - Gradual re-awakening
   - Body awareness restoration
   - Gentle eye opening
```

## Meditation Types

### Relaxation & Stress Relief
- Focus on tension release, nature imagery, floating sensations
- Use slow, flowing language with long vowel sounds
- Include progressive muscle relaxation cues

### Sleep & Insomnia
- Use monotone pacing with gradually slowing rhythm
- Avoid questions or stimulating imagery in the final third
- End with silence or ambient continuation — no "wake up" sequence
- Include body heaviness and warmth suggestions

### Mindfulness & Present Moment
- Anchor to breath, body sensations, or ambient sounds
- Use noting techniques: *"Simply noticing..."*, *"Allowing whatever arises..."*
- Minimal visualization — focus on direct experience

### Healing & Recovery
- Include light/energy visualization (warm golden light, healing waters)
- Address specific body areas with gentle, loving attention
- Incorporate self-compassion and forgiveness themes

### Manifestation & Transformation
- Future-self visualization with vivid emotional engagement
- Anchor desired states with physical gestures or breath patterns
- Include gratitude for the transformation as if already complete

### Chakra & Energy Work
- Follow the 7-chakra system (root to crown) or target specific centers
- Use corresponding colors, elements, sounds, and affirmations
- Include spinning/expanding/cleansing energy imagery

## Timing Guidelines

| Duration   | Use Case                        |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| 5 min      | Quick reset, breathing exercise |
| 10 min     | Morning/midday mindfulness      |
| 15-20 min  | Deep relaxation, healing work   |
| 30 min     | Full journey, sleep meditation  |
| 45-60 min  | Extended healing, yoga nidra    |

## Voice Direction Markers

Include these markers in scripts for narrators or TTS:

- `[SLOW]` — Reduce speaking pace
- `[WHISPER]` — Soften to near-whisper
- `[pause 3s]` — Silent pause (specify duration)
- `[breathe]` — Narrator takes audible breath
- `[gentle bell]` — Sound effect cue
- `[music: ambient pad]` — Background music cue

## Output Format

When generating a script, output:

```markdown
# [Meditation Title]

**Type:** [Relaxation | Sleep | Mindfulness | Healing | Manifestation | Chakra]
**Duration:** [estimated minutes]
**Best For:** [target audience or situation]
**Music Suggestion:** [ambient style recommendation]
