# Subliminal Scripts

Create powerful subliminal affirmation scripts designed to bypass the conscious critical filter and embed positive beliefs directly into the subconscious mind.

## Core Principles

1. **Positive Framing** — Every affirmation must be stated in the positive. Never use negation (*"I am confident"* not *"I am not afraid"*).
2. **Present Tense** — All affirmations use present tense as if the desired state already exists: *"I am..."*, *"I have..."*, *"I attract..."*
3. **First Person** — Use "I" statements for direct subconscious absorption.
4. **Simplicity** — Keep each affirmation short (5-12 words). The subconscious processes simple, direct statements best.
5. **Emotional Resonance** — Include feeling words: *"I joyfully..."*, *"I effortlessly..."*, *"I deeply feel..."*
6. **Repetition with Variation** — Repeat core themes using different phrasing to reinforce the message without monotony.
7. **Believability Gradient** — Start with easier-to-accept statements and progress to bolder ones.

## Delivery Formats

### Standard Subliminal (Below Conscious Threshold)
- Designed to be mixed below music or ambient sounds
- Spoken at normal pace, layered at -20dB to -30dB below foreground audio
- Single voice, calm and neutral tone

### Supraliminal (Barely Audible)
- Mixed at the edge of perception (-10dB to -15dB below foreground)
- Listener may catch fragments — this is intentional
- Creates a "whispering" effect

### Silent Subliminal (Frequency-Shifted)
- Script converted to ultrasonic frequency range (14kHz-20kHz)
- Requires specialized audio processing
- Provide the text script; audio engineering handles conversion

### Layered / Stacked
- Multiple tracks of the same script at different speeds and volumes
- Forward + whispered + fast-paced layers
- Creates dense affirmation saturation

## Production Notes

Include these markers in scripts:

- `[LAYER: whisper]` — Record as whisper track
