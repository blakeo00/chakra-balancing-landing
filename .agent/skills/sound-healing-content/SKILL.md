# Sound Healing Content

Create therapeutic sound healing content including session scripts, frequency prescriptions, instrument guides, and immersive sound journey narratives.

## Core Principles

1. **Frequency Intentionality** — Every frequency and instrument choice should serve a specific therapeutic purpose.
2. **Resonance & Entrainment** — Design sessions that guide the listener's brainwaves from active (beta) to relaxed (alpha/theta/delta) states.
3. **Sacred Silence** — Silence between sounds is as healing as the sounds themselves. Always include space.
4. **Somatic Awareness** — Guide listeners to notice physical sensations from sound vibrations in the body.
5. **Safety First** — Include contraindications where appropriate (e.g., epilepsy warnings for binaural beats, pregnancy considerations for deep bass frequencies).

| Beta   | 13 – 30 Hz    | Active thinking, alertness       |
| Gamma  | 30 – 100 Hz   | Peak awareness, insight          |

### Chakra Frequencies

| Chakra        | Frequency | Note | Bowl Note |
|---------------|-----------|------|-----------|
| Root          | 256 Hz    | C    | C         |
| Sacral        | 288 Hz    | D    | D         |

## Instrument Palette

### Singing Bowls
- **Crystal Bowls** — Pure, sustained tones. Best for chakra work and deep meditation.
- **Tibetan (Metal) Bowls** — Rich harmonics and overtones. Grounding and centering.
- **Alchemy Bowls** — Infused with gems/metals. Specialized tonal qualities.

### Tuning Forks
- Precision frequency delivery for targeted healing
- Weighted forks for body placement, unweighted for auric field

### Gongs
- Full-spectrum sound. Powerful for sound baths and emotional release.
- Builds from soft to crescendo ("gong wash")

### Voice
- Toning, overtone chanting, mantra, vocal harmonics
- Most personal and emotionally resonant instrument

### Nature Sounds
- Water (flowing, rain, ocean) — emotional cleansing
- Wind — release and clearing
- Earth (thunder, stones) — grounding
- Fire (crackling) — transformation

### Electronic / Synthesized
- Binaural beats, isochronal tones, drone pads
- Precise frequency control for brainwave entrainment

## Session Types

### Sound Bath Script
A facilitated group or solo session using multiple instruments.

```
1. WELCOME & GROUNDING (2-3 min)
   - Set intention
   - Guided breath to settle

2. OPENING SOUNDS (3-5 min)
   - Gentle, grounding instruments (low bowls, earth tones)
   - Establish safety and presence

3. JOURNEY / BUILD (10-20 min)
   - Layer instruments progressively
   - Move through frequency ranges or chakra system
   - Include crescendo and release cycles

4. PEAK (3-5 min)
   - Fullest sound palette
   - Emotional release point
   - Gong wash or vocal toning climax

5. INTEGRATION (5-8 min)
   - Gradual reduction to silence
   - Single sustained tone fading out
   - Extended silence (minimum 2 minutes)

6. RETURN (2-3 min)
   - Gentle chime or bell
   - Guided body awareness
   - Slow reorientation
```

### Frequency Healing Session
Targeted therapeutic frequency application.

```
1. ASSESSMENT — Identify target area (physical, emotional, energetic)
2. FREQUENCY SELECTION — Choose primary + supporting frequencies
3. DELIVERY METHOD — Binaural, singing bowl, tuning fork, or layered
4. DURATION — 15-30 min sustained exposure
5. INTEGRATION — 5 min silence + grounding
```

### Chakra Sound Journey
Sequential activation from root to crown.

```
For each chakra (7 stages, 3-5 min each):
  1. State the chakra name, location, and color
  2. Play corresponding frequency/bowl note
  3. Guide visualization of color and energy
  4. Include chakra-specific affirmation
  5. Transition sound bridge to next chakra
```
