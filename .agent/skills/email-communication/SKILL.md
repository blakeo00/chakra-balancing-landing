# Email & Communication Writing

This skill helps you write communications that land well — emails that get responses, messages that maintain relationships, and letters that accomplish their purpose without creating confusion or conflict.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Drafting professional emails
- Writing sensitive or difficult messages
- Following up without being annoying
- Requesting something from someone
- Delivering news (good or bad)
- Responding to complaints or concerns
- Cold outreach and introductions
- Internal team communications
- Client and customer correspondence

---

## THE FUNDAMENTALS

### The Reader's Perspective

Before writing anything, ask:
- What does this person need to know?
- What do I need from them?
- What's their likely state of mind?
- How busy are they?
- What's our relationship?

Every communication competes for attention. Respect that.

### The Three Questions Every Email Should Answer

1. **Why am I receiving this?** (Context)
2. **What do I need to know?** (Information)
3. **What do I need to do?** (Action)

If your email doesn't answer these clearly, rewrite it.

## EMAIL STRUCTURE

### Subject Lines

The subject line is your first impression. Make it count.

**Effective subject lines:**
- Specific: "Meeting rescheduled to Thursday 2pm"
- Action-oriented: "Need your input on proposal by Friday"
- Clear: "Q3 Report — Ready for Review"
- Honest: "Quick question about the Henderson project"

**Avoid:**
- Vague: "Update" / "Quick question" / "Hey"
- Misleading: "URGENT" when it isn't
- Too long: Subject lines get cut off on mobile
- ALL CAPS: Unless genuinely urgent

### Opening Lines

Skip the throat-clearing. Get to the point.

**Instead of:**
```
I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out 
because I've been thinking about our conversation last week 
and I realized there's something I should mention...
```

**Try:**
```
Following up on our conversation last week — I have a 
question about the timeline.
```

**Good openers by situation:**

| Situation | Opening |
|-----------|---------|
| Following up | "Following up on [specific thing]..." |
| Request | "I'm hoping you can help with..." |
| Update | "Quick update on [project]..." |
| Response needed | "I need your input on [specific item]..." |
| Good news | "Great news about [thing]..." |
| Bad news | "I need to let you know about a change..." |
| Introduction | "I'm reaching out because..." |

### The Body

**Keep paragraphs short.** One idea per paragraph. White space is your friend.

**Use formatting strategically:**
- Bold for key dates, names, or actions (sparingly)
- Bullets only when you have a genuine list
- Numbered lists when sequence matters

**Front-load important information.** Don't bury the lead in paragraph three.

### Closing and Call to Action

Be explicit about what you need:

**Weak:**
```
Let me know what you think.
```

**Stronger:**
```
Could you review the attached and let me know by Thursday 
if anything needs adjustment?
```

**Specific asks work better:**
- "Could you confirm this works for your schedule?"
- "Please reply with your top choice by [date]."
- "If I don't hear back by Friday, I'll proceed with Option A."

### Sign-offs

Match the relationship and context:

| Relationship | Appropriate Sign-offs |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Formal/new contact | Best regards, Sincerely |
| Established professional | Best, Thanks |
| Friendly colleague | Thanks!, Cheers |
| Quick reply | Just your name, or nothing |

## COMMON EMAIL TYPES

### The Request Email

Structure:
1. Brief context (why you're asking)
2. The specific request
3. Why it matters / what you'll do with it
4. Timeline if relevant
5. Easy out (optional but gracious)

**Example:**
```
Subject: Quick question about your vendor experience

Hi Sarah,

I'm researching payment processing options for our new 
project and remembered you switched to Stripe last year.

Would you be willing to share how that's been going? 
Specifically interested in setup difficulty and any 
hidden costs.

Happy to buy you coffee in exchange for 15 minutes of 
your time, or a quick email response works too if 
that's easier.

Thanks,
[Name]
```

### The Follow-Up Email

The key: add value, don't just "bump."

**Don't:**
```
Just following up on my last email...
```

**Do:**
```
Hi Marcus,

Circling back on the proposal I sent last Tuesday. 
I realized I should mention that the early-bird 
pricing expires this Friday.

Happy to answer any questions if that would help.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Follow-up timing:**
- First follow-up: 3-5 business days
- Second follow-up: 1 week later
- After that: Consider whether to continue

### The Difficult Conversation Email

When delivering bad news or addressing conflict:

1. **Don't delay** — waiting makes it worse
2. **Be direct** — don't bury the news
3. **Take responsibility** where appropriate
4. **Offer solutions** or next steps
5. **Keep it brief** — don't over-explain

**Example:**
```
Subject: Change to project timeline

Hi Team,

I need to let you know that we won't make the April 15 
deadline. The vendor delay I mentioned last week has 
extended further than expected.

New target date: April 29.

I've already spoken with the client, and they're 
understanding. Here's what we're doing to prevent 
further delays: [brief list]

I take responsibility for not building more buffer 
into the original timeline. Happy to discuss further 
in our Thursday standup.

[Name]
```

### The Cold Outreach Email

Cold emails have seconds to prove their worth. Every word must earn its place.

**Structure:**
1. Hook (why should they care?)
2. Credibility (why you?)
3. Value (what's in it for them?)
4. Ask (one clear, easy action)

**Keep it short.** Under 150 words ideally.

**Example:**
```
Subject: Idea for your podcast

Hi Jordan,

I caught your episode with [Guest] about burnout 
in creative industries — your point about "productive 
rest" stuck with me.

I'm a sound therapist who works with burned-out 
creatives, and I've developed a framework that might 
resonate with your audience: using specific sound 
frequencies to shift from "wired and tired" to 
actual recovery.

Would you be open to a 20-minute conversation to 
see if it's a fit for the show?

Either way, keep making great episodes.

[One line of credentials]

### The Apology Email

Effective apologies have three parts:

1. **Acknowledge** what happened (specifically)
2. **Take responsibility** (no "but" or excuses)
3. **State what you're doing** to fix it or prevent recurrence

**Example:**
```
Subject: Apology for missed deadline

Hi Chen,

I missed the Monday deadline for the brand guidelines, 
and I'm sorry. You were counting on having those for 
your client meeting.

I underestimated the scope and should have flagged 
that earlier instead of going silent.

The guidelines are attached now — I've prioritized 
them this morning. For future projects, I'm going to 
check in mid-way if I'm tracking behind so you have 
time to adjust.

Again, I apologize for the inconvenience.

[Name]
```

## TONE AND RELATIONSHIP

### Reading the Room

Match your tone to:
- The relationship (new vs. established)
- The culture (formal company vs. casual startup)
- The situation (routine vs. high-stakes)
- The recipient's communication style

When in doubt, mirror their energy. If they write formally, respond formally. If they use exclamation points and emoji, you can too.

### Warmth Without Fluff

You can be warm and efficient:

**Cold and abrupt:**
```
Send me the file.
```

**Warm but efficient:**
```
Could you send me that file when you get a chance? Thanks!
```

**Too much:**
```
Hi! I hope you're having the most wonderful day! 
I was just wondering, if it's not too much trouble, 
if you might possibly be able to send me that file? 
Only if you have time, of course! No pressure at all! 
Thank you so so much!!!
```

### Softening Without Weakening

Some phrases soften without undermining your message:

- "I'd appreciate..." (instead of "I need")
- "Would you be able to..." (instead of "Can you")
- "I wanted to check in about..." (instead of "Why haven't you")
- "I may have missed it, but..." (gives them an out)

Use these strategically, not excessively.

## COMMON MISTAKES

### The Over-Explainer
Every email doesn't need the full backstory. Include only what the reader needs.

### The Hedge-Everything Email
"I was just wondering if maybe possibly you might..." — state your ask clearly.

### The Wall of Text
Break it up. Use paragraphs. Respect the reader's eyes.

### The Passive-Aggressive CC
Adding someone's boss to "keep them in the loop" when you're actually escalating. Just escalate directly and honestly.

### The Reply-All Offender
Ask yourself: Does everyone need to see this?

### The Vague Subject Line
"Quick thing" tells the reader nothing and makes the email hard to find later.

## TEMPLATES TO ADAPT

### Meeting Request
```
Subject: [Topic] — meeting request

Hi [Name],

I'd like to schedule [time length] to discuss [specific topic].

Context: [One sentence on why this matters now]

I'm available [2-3 specific options], but happy to work 
around your schedule.

Thanks,
[Name]
```

### Saying No Gracefully
```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for thinking of me for [opportunity/request].

After considering it, I'm going to pass this time — 
[brief honest reason, optional].

[If appropriate: alternative suggestion or future opening]

I appreciate you reaching out.

Best,
[Name]
```

### Asking for Feedback
```
Subject: Request for feedback on [thing]

Hi [Name],

I've attached [document/link] and would love your input.

Specifically, I'm wondering about:
- [Specific question 1]
- [Specific question 2]

No rush, but if you could share thoughts by [date], 
that would help me [reason].

Thanks in advance,
[Name]
```

## FINAL THOUGHTS

The best emails feel like a conversation, not a performance. They respect the reader's time while accomplishing your purpose.

When in doubt: shorter, clearer, kinder.
